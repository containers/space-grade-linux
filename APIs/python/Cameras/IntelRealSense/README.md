Intel RealSense cameras are advanced 3D depth-sensing devices that combine stereo vision, infrared (IR) sensors, and sometimes RGB cameras to capture depth and color data in real-time. They are used in robotics, AR/VR, facial recognition, and object detection, enabling machines to perceive and understand their environment. Popular models include D435i (stereo depth) and L515 (LiDAR-based).
